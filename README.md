# cov_dashboard
A dashboard to visualize Covid-19 Cases and Deaths by US State

Currently this is a work in progress and is not as clean as I would like it to be. Updates will come over time and allow for better visibility of the data
and allow for a user to get more specific with their requests. 


To serve the dashboard locally, use the command:

```panel serve cov_cases_dash.ipynb```
